### About me
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am Pouya Hamadanian, a PhD student at the Networks and Mobile Systems (NMS) group at the Computer Science and Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), MIT.
I am advised by [Mohammad Alizadeh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alizadeh/), and I work on the intersection of Machine Learning and Systems, and recently I've been researching Cloud Gaming Solutions.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In the summer of 2022, I completed a research internship in Microsoft Research Seattle, at the Networking Research Group (NRG) under the supervision of [Krishna Chintalapudi](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/krchinta/). I designed a system called Ekho, which is a synchronization schemes for cloud gaming media, and we published <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3603269.3604826">Ekho at SIGCOMM '23</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the summer of 2023, I completed another research internship in Microsoft Research Seattle, at the Networking Research Group (NRG) under the supervision of <a href="https://sadjad.org">Sadjad Fouladi</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ranveer/">Ranveer Chandra</a>. I worked on the interplay of the networking domain and Large Language Models; I investigated how LLMs could be useful for debugging networking problems, and how we can design efficient inference systems for LLMs.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I received an EECS M.S. degree from MIT in 2022, and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran.
</p>

Broadly, my research interests include:
* Robust Reinforcement Learning in Practical Applications
* Safe/Non-stationary Continual Learning
* Data-driven Simulation
* Cloud Game Streaming Technology
* LLM inference/training frameworks
